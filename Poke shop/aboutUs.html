      <h2>So You Want To Know About Poke</h2>

      <img src="/Images/info.jpeg" alt="resto" />

      <p>
        The first thing to know is that poke is, and has always been, a
        restaurant catering to anyone that wants healthy food fast done their
        way.
      </p>

      <p>
        The three shadowy figures who created poke wanted to make sure everyone
        had the freedom to good food that was still healthy. A place for
        families to bring their children. Poke has always understood that
        maintaining a healthy diet is difficult. What we know far more is that
        it shouldn't be!
      </p>

      <h2>The Right Tool For The Job</h2>

      <p>
        Using only locally sourced and fresh ingredients, poke allows you tasty
        and freeing experience with health eating. Beginning as a small chain
        and eventually to the renowned name that you know so well, Poke has
        always kept to its original promises
      </p>

      <p>
        Our restaurants allow any customer to choose what food is right for
        them. Our environment designed to be calm yet fun, a place to relax
        and unwind with a nice snack or a buffet you never have to feel guilty
        about.
      </p>

      <h2>Coming Together</h2>
      <p>
        A significant reason Poke was able to achieve its size so quickly was
        our early willingness to work with new media outlets, such as social
        media and viral ad campaigns. Poke is at the cutting edge of both
        good/healthy food, as well as getting our name out there! We knew that
        we wouldn't be able to appeal to young people unless we spoke in a way
        they actually wanted to listen to!
      </p>

      <p>
        We offer extremely competitive packages and reward programs for
        influencers that are dedicated to our relationship. One of the ways we
        got as much popularity as we did with content creators is meeting them
        in the middle. We don't simply make deal with the largest platforms
        available, we reward based on proportional growth to your audience, and
        bring more people to you in turn with our own platform. Our intention is
        to add to the internet landscape in meaningful ways, and we know the
        internet will treat us well in kind.
